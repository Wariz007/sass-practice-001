Peoject: First SASS Practice using Basic SASS features

This README file is a personal note to self to record the things I learnt, found challenging, and problems I am yet to solve so I can revisit in future for reference purposes.

This simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project is my first attempt at using SASS.My plan is to continue to practice SASS with simple practice projects like these, and then gradually increase the difficulty of the projects, while I also adopt SASS in my main projects. 

SASS is a great tool that relieves a lot of stress you might encounter using vanilla CSS. For example, I can create partials for different aspects of my projects and then import them into the main SCSS file that gets compiled into CSS, I can nest code in the element that contains another element, I also love mixins, and it doesn't get in the way of using JavaScript.

Being my first attempt, I encountered some difficulty like feeling disorganized because of how many files I had open doing the same thing which is writing CSS, another problem was the hierachy at which I had to import my files. I did not know config and mixins partials has to be at the top so they could be compiled first, so I was confused when I tried to use a variable or mixin and I was getting an error message.

But I know these things now, and I look forward to making more mistakes so I can learn from them.

SASS features learnt:
-Partials
-Variables
-Mixins
-nesting
